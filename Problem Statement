Problem Statement:
 - The dataset contains extensive transactional records with minimal prior labeling, making it challenging to understand inherent patterns or relationships among data points.

 - The primary goal is to explore and uncover natural groupings or structures within the data using clustering techniques, without relying on predefined categories.

 - By applying unsupervised learning, the project aims to identify hidden patterns, similarities, and anomalies that can provide deeper insights into customer behavior and operational trends.

 - The outcome is expected to support data-driven decision-makingâ€”enabling segmentation, trend detection, and strategic planning across business or analytical functions.
