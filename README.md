# Unsupervised-Learning-Clustering
Unsupervised Learning is a machine learning technique that finds patterns in unlabeled data. It aims to discover the hidden structure of data without predefined outputs. It is crucial for exploring and understanding unknown data, and it enables pattern discovery without prior knowledge and is foundational in data science pipelines.
